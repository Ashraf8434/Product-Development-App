# PetroAnalysis App

## Overview

The **PetroAnalysis** app is an innovative PyQt-based application developed by our team to analyse petrophysical data derived from well logs. Under the guidance of Partha Sir, this project aims to provide geophysicists and geologists with a robust tool that enhances their ability to interpret reservoir characteristics accurately.

Our team is committed to continuously enhancing the PetroAnalysis app. We welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from users and developers alike. By providing an efficient, comprehensive tool for petrophysical analysis, we aim to support the scientific and engineering communities in understanding and utilizing subsurface resources more effectively.

We believe that PetroAnalysis will become an invaluable resource for anyone involved in petrophysical studies, and we look forward to your insights and contributions to improve this tool further.
